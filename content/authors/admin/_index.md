Hello! I'm a passionate and driven computer programming student currently refining my skills at Seneca Polytechnic. With a strong foundation in programming principles and a love for hands-on experience, I'm excited to dive deeper into the world of technology.

Throughout my academic journey, I've become proficient in languages such as C, C++, JavaScript, and SQL, while also mastering essential tools like Linux. My focus has been on exploring the intricacies of web development, where I've delved into the depths of Node.js and honed my skills in both frontend and backend development.

<!-- My passion for programming extends beyond the classroom as I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to the tech community. Whether it's collaborating on group projects or participating in coding competitions, I thrive in environments that challenge me to push the boundaries of my abilities. -->

I'm committed to delivering high-quality work, meeting project deadlines, and continuously honing my craft. With a keen interest in software testing, database management, and web development, I'm ready to hit the ground running and explore the endless possibilities that the tech world has to offer.
